* doom-emacs-private
My [[https://github.com/hlissner/doom-emacs][Doom Emacs]] configuration.

Installation is easiest with git, simply execute
#+begin_src shell
git clone https://github.com/lovewestlundgotby/doom-emacs-private ~/.config/doom
#+end_src

If you didn't already get Doom itself, it is probably installed with something like
#+begin_src shell
git clone --depth 1 https://github.com/hlissner/doom-emacs ~/.config/emacs
~/.config/emacs/bin/doom install
#+end_src
You can always yolo it and try, if it doesn't work, simply check out [[https://github.com/hlissner/doom-emacs#install][Doom's installation instructions]].
